# Honeybee-Image-Analysis-Identifying-Pollen-with-AI

This project utilizes TensorFlow and scikit-learn to develop a machine learning model for detecting pollen grains in honeybee images.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: [Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ivanfel/honey-bee-pollen). It consists of honeybee images with pollen annotations.

## Libraries Used

- numpy, pandas
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn, TensorFlow

## Data Preprocessing

- Load and preprocess images
- Resize images to a consistent size
- Data augmentation for improved generalization

## Model Architecture

- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image feature extraction
- Suitable for image classification tasks

## Training and Evaluation

- Split dataset into training and validation sets
- Train using Adam optimizer
- Evaluate using confusion matrix and classification report

## Usage

1. Clone repository: `git clone https://github.com/umairrrkhan/Honeybee-Image-Analysis-Identifying-Pollen-with-AI.git`
2. Navigate to directory: `cd pollen_detection`
3. Set up environment and required dependencies
4. Run notebooks in `notebooks/` for data exploration and model training
5. Utilize trained model for pollen detection on new images
